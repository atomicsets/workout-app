# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Workout Tracker ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal data.

## Data Controller

Atomic Sets operates from the European Union and complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For authentication services, we use Supabase, with data stored in AWS EU-West (Ireland), ensuring your data remains within the European Union.

## Information We Collect

We take a privacy-first approach and collect only the minimum information necessary to provide our services.

### Information You Provide

- **Account Information:** Email address and password when you create an account (for authentication purposes only)
- **Subscription Information:** Payment and subscription status (processed and stored by third-party payment providers; we do NOT store payment card details)

### Information We DO NOT Collect

We do NOT collect, store, or transmit:

- **Workout Data:** All workout logs, exercise history, sets, reps, weights, and personal notes are stored ONLY on your device
- **Personal Health Information:** We do not collect any health or fitness data
- **Device Information:** We do not collect device identifiers, operating system details, or device-specific information
- **Usage Analytics:** We do not track your app usage patterns or behavior

We do NOT use your information for:

- Marketing or promotional purposes

- Sharing with third parties (except as legally required)

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only

**Your Workout Data Stays on Your Device:**

- **All workout data** (exercises, sets, reps, weights, notes, templates, history) is stored ONLY on your device using encrypted local storage
- We do NOT sync, backup, or transmit your workout data to any cloud servers
- You maintain complete control over your workout data at all times
- Your data never leaves your device

### Backup Your Data

Since your workout data is stored locally:

- **iOS Users:** Use iCloud Backup to automatically back up your app data (managed by Apple, subject to Apple's privacy policy)
- **Android Users:** Use Google Backup or your device's backup solution (managed by Google, subject to Google's privacy policy)
- **Manual Export:** You can export your data from within the app for your own backup purposes

### What We Store (Minimal Cloud Data)

We only store on our secure servers:

- **Email address and hashed password:** For account authentication
- **Subscription status:** To verify premium access (no payment details)

### Security Measures

- **Encrypted data transmission (TLS/SSL):** All communication between the app and our servers is encrypted
- **Secure password hashing:** We use industry-standard bcrypt or similar algorithms
- **No data collection:** Since we don't collect workout data, it can't be compromised on our servers
- **Regular security updates:** We maintain and update our authentication systems

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do NOT sell, rent, or trade your personal information.**

Since we collect minimal data and your workout data stays on your device, there is very little to share. We may share the limited account data we collect only in these circumstances:

### Service Providers

- **Authentication Services:** For secure login functionality
- **Payment Processors:** For subscription management (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store) - they handle all payment data

All service providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for specified purposes.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose your account information when:

- Required by law, court order, or governmental regulation
- Necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users
